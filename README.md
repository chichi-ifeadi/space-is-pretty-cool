# Universe Database: Explore the Cosmos ðŸŒŒ  

This project is a **Universe Database** that organizes and manages data about galaxies, stars, planets, moons, and other celestial objects. While the dataset is not exhaustive, it provided a solid foundation for learning and utilizing **PostgreSQL**, **Bash scripting**, and **SQL**, showcasing database design, automation, and data manipulation skills.  

## Features  
- **Relational Database Design**:  
  - Five interconnected tables (`galaxy`, `star`, `planet`, `moon`, and `extra`) designed with proper constraints, data types, and relationships.  
- **Bash Automation**:  
  - A Bash script automates parsing and loading data from CSV files into the PostgreSQL database.  
  - Includes error handling, dynamic foreign key resolution, and support for special characters in text fields (e.g., apostrophes).  
- **Data Integrity**:  
  - Ensures accurate relationships between celestial objects through primary and foreign keys.  
  - Handles edge cases for clean and consistent data insertion.  
- **Scalable Structure**:  
  - The schema is built to allow for future data expansion or customization.  

## Technologies Used  
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database management system for structured data.  
- **Bash Scripting**: Streamlines data loading and ensures efficiency and reproducibility.  
- **SQL**: Powers the management of data insertion, updates, and table relationships.  

## Why Itâ€™s Cool ðŸš€  
- Organizes astronomical data in a structured, relational format.  
- Demonstrates core technical skills in database design, scripting, and automation.  
- Serves as a stepping stone for more advanced projects or applications.  

## A Learning Experience ðŸŒŸ  
Though the data isn't exhaustive, building this project gave me invaluable hands-on experience with core database and scripting technologies. It reinforced my understanding of relational database design and taught me the importance of automation and data integrity when working with real-world datasets.
